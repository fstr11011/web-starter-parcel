# Web Starter Parcel

Web starter using ParcelJS for learnjavascript.online

This boilerplate is provided at the end of the [Learn JavaScript](https://learnjavascript.online) course.

## Setup

**First time**

```bash

## Parcel

This starter uses parcel to bundle your scripts.

You can import other files. Make sure you have the correct path. You can also import libraries installed with NPM. We already included an example for you with **date-fns**. Feel free to remove it if you don't need it.

## Build for production

When you're ready to deploy, you can build for production with the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```
